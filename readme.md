# Final Project - Music Discovery
(By Max Divak, Squad A)

Purpose: To explore Python, Flask, the Spotify API and maybe discover some new music.

## To Build

Ensure you have:

* **python3**

### Install

```
$ pip3 install flask
$ pip3 install spotipy --upgrade
$ pip3 install Flask-WTF
```

### Spotify Developer Account

To use the API you need a Spotify user account (free or premium). Sign up at https://www.spotify.com/us/

Once you sign up, login to the Spotify developer dashboard https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login

* **Once logged into the Dashboard, click the green 'CREATE AN APP' button**
* **Name your app and copy your 'client ID' and 'client secret ID'**
* **Add these IDs to the 'config.py' file. Assign them to the appropriate variable**

## To Run

```
$ cd to the project directory
$ python3 main.py
```
(Ctrl + C to quit)

## To Use

Once Flask is running, open a browser and copy `http://127.0.0.1:5000` into the address bar.
